           1. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access as a student, when you enroll in a course or other content, whether it’s free or paid content, you are getting a 
           license from <span class="logo">C2S</span> Ltd to view the content via the <span class="logo">C2S</span>platform and Services, and <span class="logo">C2S</span> is the licensor of record. Content is 
           licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing account information with a 
           purchaser or illegally downloading the content and sharing it on torrent sites). In legal, more complete terms, <span class="logo">C2S</span> grants you (as a student) a 
           limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, 
           non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with the particular 
           content or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, 
           share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any content unless we give you explicit permission to
           do so in a written agreement signed by a <span class="logo">C2S</span> authorized representative. We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they
           enroll in a course or other content. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point in time in the event where
           we decide or are obligated to disable access to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or other content you enrolled in is
           the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. This lifetime access license does not apply to enrollments
           via Subscription Plans or to add-on features and services associated with the course or other content you enroll in. For example, instructors may decide at any
           time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with the content.<br><br>
         
           2. Payments, Credits, and Refunds <br><br>

           2.1 Pricing

           The prices of content on <span class="logo">C2S</span> Ltd are determined based prevailing decisions of directors of the company.

           We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set 
           
           period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout).
           
           Any price offered for particular content may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who
           
           aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.

           If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when you created your account. If you are not 
           
           logged into your account, the price currency is based on the country where you are located. We do not enable users to see pricing in other
           
           currencies. If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable
           
           to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location,
           
           the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.<br><br>

           2.2 Payments
          
           You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other
           
           means of payment for those fees. <span class="logo">C2S</span> works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods 
           
           in your country and to keep your payment information secure. We may update your payment methods using information provided by our 
           
           payment service providers. When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment 
           
           method fails and you still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty
           
           (30) days of notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any content for which we have not received adequate 
           
           payment.<br><br>

           2.3 Refunds
           
           If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the content, that 
           
           <span class="logo">C2S</span> apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to Subscription Plan purchases. We reserve the right
           
           to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our
           
           payment service providers, the platform from which you purchased your content (website, mobile), and other factors. No refund is due to
           
           you if you request it after the 7 days upon enrolling for a course or after attending up to 2 class lectures. However, if the course you
           
           previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 7 days limit or the attendance of
           
           up to 3 class lectures. <span class="logo">C2S</span> also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 7 days limit or the attendance of up to 2 
           
           class lectures in cases of suspected or confirmed account fraud.

           You may not receive a full refund, the amount you receive in refunds may be dependent on how much of contents you may have 
           
           consumed and/or the extent of our resources (whether directly or indirectly) you may have used.

           At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant portion of the content 
           
           that you want to refund or if you’ve previously refunded the content, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict you from other
           
           future refunds, ban your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your access to the 
           
           content due to your violation of these Terms, you will not be eligible to receive a refund.<br><br>

           2.4 Gift and Promotional Codes
           
           <span class="logo">C2S</span> Ltd or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students. Certain codes may be redeemed for gift or 

           promotional credits applied to your <span class="logo">C2S</span> account, which then may be used to purchase eligible content on our platform,
           
           subject to the terms included with your codes. Other codes may be directly redeemable for specific content. Gift and promotional
           
           credits can’t be used for purchases in our mobile.

           These codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period
           
           specified in your <span class="logo">C2S</span> account. Gift and promotional codes offered by <span class="logo">C2S</span> may not be refunded for cash,
           
           unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes or as required by applicable law. Gift and promotional codes 
           
           offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s refund policies. If you have multiple saved credit amounts, <span class="logo">C2S</span> may
           
           determine which of your credits to apply to your purchase. Check out our Support Page and any terms included with your codes for

           non-infringement. We (and our affiliates, suppliers, partners, and agents) make no warranty that you will obtain specific results 
           
           from use of the Services. Your use of the Services (including any content) is entirely at your own risk. Some jurisdictions don’t 
           
           allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so some of the above exclusions may not apply to you.

           We may decide to cease making available certain features of the Services at any time and for any reason. Under no circumstances will 
           
           <span class="logo">C2S</span> Ltd or its affiliates, suppliers, partners or agents be held liable for any damages due to such interruptions or lack of
           
           availability of such features. We are not responsible for delay or failure of our performance of any of the Services caused by events 
           
           beyond our reasonable control, like an act of war, hostility, or sabotage; natural disaster; electrical, internet, or telecommunication 
           
           outage; or government restrictions.<br><br>

           6.3 Indemnification


           If you behave in a way that gets us in legal trouble, we may exercise legal recourse against you. You agree to indemnify, defend 
           
           (if we so request), and hold harmless <span class="logo">C2S</span>, our group companies, and their officers, directors, suppliers, partners, and
           
           agents from an against any third-party claims, demands, losses, damages, or expenses (including reasonable attorney fees) arising from 
           
           (a) the content you post or submit, (b) your use of the Services (c) your violation of these Terms, or (d) your violation of any
           
           rights of a third party. Your indemnification obligation will survive the termination of these Terms and your use of the Services.<br><br>


           6.4 Governing Law and Jurisdiction

           When these Terms mention “<span class="logo">C2S</span>,” they’re referring to the <span class="logo">C2S</span>entity that you’re contracting with. If you’re a
           
           student, your contracting entity and governing law will generally be determined based on your location.<br><br>


           6.5 Legal Actions and Notices

           No action, regardless of form, arising out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by either party more than one (1) year after
           
           the cause of action has accrued, except where this limitation cannot be imposed by law.<br><br>


           Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given by registered or certified mail return receipt 
           
           requested, or email (by us to the email associated with your account or by you to codesolve8@gmail.com).


           6.6 Relationship Between Us

           You and we agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, contractor, or agency relationship exists between us.<br><br>


           6.7 No Assignment

           You may not assign or transfer these Terms (or the rights and licenses granted under them). For example, if you registered an account
           
           as an employee of a company, your account cannot be transferred to another employee. We may assign these Terms (or the rights and 
           
           licenses granted under them) to another company or person without restriction. Nothing in these Terms confers any right, benefit, or
           
           remedy on any third-party person or entity. You agree that your account is non-transferable and that all rights to your account and
           
           other rights under these Terms terminate upon your death.<br><br>


           7. Dispute Resolution

           If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work your options are to bring a claim in
           
           binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.<br><br>


           7.1 Going to Arbitration

           If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and <span class="logo">C2S</span> agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms (or our other legal
           
           terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that
           
           should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration
           
           (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.<br><br>


           7.2 The Arbitration Process

           Any disputes that involve a claim of less than N7,000,000 or $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based 
           
           arbitration. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, 
           
           online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any 
           
           personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator’s rendered
           
           award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction.<br><br>


           7.3 No Class Actions

           We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a 
           
           claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t 
           
           combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an
           
           arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can’t be used to decide other 
           
           users’ disputes. If a court decides that this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution” 
           
           section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.<br><br>


           8. Updating These Terms

           From time to time, we may update these Terms to clarify our practices or to reflect new or different practices (such as when we add new
           
           features), and <span class="logo">C2S</span> reserves the right in its sole discretion to modify and/or make changes to these Terms at any time. 
           
           Modifications will become effective on the day they are posted unless stated otherwise.


           Your continued use of our Services after changes become effective shall mean that you accept those changes. Any revised Terms shall 
           
           supersede all previous Terms.<br><br>
